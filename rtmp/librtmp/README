You can chose any one as your rtmplib when you need to get a rtmplib and a rtmpserver
If you need a rtmpserver running on emdbedded platform .e.g mips, then srs is recommend
If you just need a rtmplib to build you rtmpclient, personaly rtmpdump is recommend, it builds more easy and
it looks there's some bug for srs(it's aac dosen't support 8000Hz sample rate, seriously it just support 5.5kHz 11kHz 22kHz 44kHz).
